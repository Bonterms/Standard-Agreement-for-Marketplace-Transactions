## How to Use: Bonterms Standard Agreement for Marketplace Transactions

## Overview:
The Bonterms Standard Agreement for Marketplace Transactions (Version 1.0) is designed to ease contracting between Providers and Customers in an enterprise app Marketplace.

Once adopted by the Marketplace, individual Providers can designate the Standard Agreement as the end user terms under which their Product, either a Cloud Servicer or Provider Software (installed software), is made available to the Customer.

The Standard Agreement is the end user agreement governing use of the Product between the Provider and Customer. The purchase terms for the Subscription remain separate between the Marketplace provider (or other reseller) and the Customer.

The Marketplace itself does not enter into the Bonterms Standard Agreement and the Standard Agreement does not modify any other terms between (i) the Marketplace and the Provider or (ii) the Marketplace and the Customer (such as purchase terms).

The Bonterms Standard Agreement is free to use by all parties under CC BY ND.
