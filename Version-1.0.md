# Bonterms Standard Agreement for Marketplace Transactions (Version 1.0)

*Role of Bonterms*. Bonterms publishes this Standard Agreement but is not a party to the Agreement created between Provider and Customer and has no responsibility to either for its use.

**1. Using this Standard Agreement**.

**1.1. Standard Agreement**. This Bonterms Standard Agreement for Marketplace Transactions (Version 1.0) (“**Standard Agreement**”) sets forth the terms and conditions under which Provider makes available Subscriptions to its Cloud Service or Provider Software (each, a “**Product**”) offered through a Listing on the Marketplace. Provider may (i) make additions to or modifications of this Standard Agreement (“**Additional Terms**”) or (ii) add Attachments by stating as such in its Listing. Any Additional Terms and any Attachments are collectively referred to as “**Provider-Specific Terms.**” Capitalized terms are defined in context or in Section 20 (Definitions).

**1.2. Entering the Agreement**. Customer and Provider agree to this Standard Agreement and any Provider-Specific Terms (collectively, the “**Agreement**”) upon Customer’s first entry into an Order (“**Effective Date**”).

**1.3. Orders**. As specified in the Marketplace, an Order may be between Customer and the Marketplace provider (or other reseller or agent of Provider) or directly with Provider. Each Order creates a separate Agreement between Provider and Customer but Orders do not become part of the Agreement.

**1.4. Order Placement**. In the event of a conflict between the elements of the terms and conditions making up the Agreement, the order of precedence is: (i) any Amendment, (ii) Provider-Specific Terms and (iii) this Standard Agreement.

**2. Products**.

**2.1 Cloud Service.** Subject to this Agreement, Customer may use the Cloud Service for its own business purposes in accordance with the Permitted Use.

**2.2 Provideer Software.** Subject to this Agreement, Customer may install, copy and use the Provider Software for its own business purposes in accordance with the Permitted Use.

**2.3 Users.** Customer may permit Users to use the Product on its behalf. Customer is responsible for provisioning and managing its User accounts, for its Users’ actions through the Product and for their compliance with this Agreement. Customer will ensure that Users keep their login credentials confidential and will promptly notify Provider upon learning of any compromise of User accounts or credentials.

**3. Customer Data.**

**3.1 Use of Customer Data.** Subject to this Agreement, Provider will access and use Customer Data solely to provide and maintain the Cloud Service, Support and Professional Services under this Agreement (“**Use of Customer Data**”). Use of Customer Data includes sharing Customer Data as Customer directs through the Cloud Service, but Provider will not otherwise disclose Customer Data to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement.

If no Security Measures are identified, Provider will use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of Customer Data.

**3.3 DPA.** The parties will adhere to the Data Protection Addendum (DPA), if any, identified in the Provider-Specific Terms.

**3.4 Usage Data.** Provider may collect Usage Data and use it to operate, improve and support the Product and for other lawful business purposes, including benchmarking and reports. However, Provider will not disclose Usage Data externally unless it is (a) de-identified so that it does not identify Customer, its Users or any other person and (b) aggregated with data across other customers.

**5 Support and SLA.**

**5.1 Support.** Provider will provide Support for the Product as described in any Support Policy identified in the Provider-Specific Terms.

**5.2 SLA.** Provider will adhere to any Service Level Agreement (SLA) identified in the Provider-Specific Terms.

**6. Warranties.**

  (a) it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and
  
  (b)it will use industry-standard measures to avoid introducing Viruses into the Cloud Service.

**6.2 Performance Warranty.**

  **(a) Scope.** Provider warrants that the Product will perform materially as described in the     Documentation and that Provider will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Cloud Service during the Subscription Term (the “**Performance Warranty**”).

  **(b) Claim Report.** Customer must report a breach of warranty in reasonable detail (“**Claim**”) within 30 days after discovering the issue in the Product (“**Claim Period**”).

  **(c) Remedy.** Within 30 days of receiving a verified Claim during the Claim Period (“**Fix Period**”), Provider will use reasonable efforts to correct or provide a reasonable workaround (“**Fix**”) for the Claim. If Provider fails to provide a Fix during the Fix Period, either party may on notice to the other terminate the Subscription as it relates to the nonconforming Product and Provider will refund to Customer any prepaid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

  (d) Exclusive Remedy. **The procedures set forth in this Section 6.2 are Customer’s exclusive remedies and Provider’s sole liability for breach of the Performance Warranty.**

6.3 Disclaimers. **Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, each party disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and noninfringement. Provider’s warranties in this Section 6 do not apply to issues arising from Third-Party Platforms or misuse or unauthorized modifications of the Product. These disclaimers apply to the full extent permitted by Law.**

The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement, with notice to the other party, in connection with the assigning party’s merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.

  (a) This Agreement is the parties’ entire agreement regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding its subject matter. In this Agreement, headings are for convenience only and “including” and similar terms are to be construed without limitation.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including electronic copies and PDFs), each of which is deemed an original and which together form one and the same agreement.

**19.7 Waivers and Severability**. Waivers must be signed by the waiving party’s authorized representative and cannot be implied from conduct.

If a Force Majeure materially adversely affects the Product for 15 or more consecutive days, either party may terminate the affected Subscription upon notice to the other and Provider will refund to Customer any prepaid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. However, this Section 19.8 does not limit Customer’s obligations to pay fees owed.

**19.9 Subcontractors**. Provider may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise Provider’s rights and fulfill Provider’s obligations, but Provider remains responsible for each subcontractor’s compliance with this Agreement and for Provider’s overall performance under this Agreement.
